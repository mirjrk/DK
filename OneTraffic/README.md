One traffic is an application that provides necessary information about all relevant factors on the road. 

It is a mobile communication platform between drivers and important POIs, and allows different users to navigate vehicles to requested places, to see relevant events on the road, and to make ads.

This is a Oslo/San Francisco startup with huge world market potential in the near future.

Application is in the beta testing phase.
